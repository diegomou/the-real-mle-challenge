WHY WILLIAMSBURG?

Williamsburg is FABULOUS. It's fast growing and it's fast changing. It's hip. In the 1960's the new and exciting place where culture was blooming was Greenwich Village. In the 70's the SOHO neighborhood was where cheap industrial loft space were being turned into places where the adventurous could move to New York, live cheaply and make the new art, music, and culture. These days Williamsburg has that special chemistry of the New York that's constantly renewing itself.

I am a working mother and artist who lives in one of the best neighborhoods in New York City with my teenaged son, Idriys, and our adorable toy poodle, Chester.  We have been offering our properties since 2010 in NYC and since 2013 in Washington DC. I manage the property in DC for my big sister, Khadijah, who is an attorney and interior designer. She lives in the attached house there. While I will handle all of your arrangements beforehand, I am based in NYC. Upon arrival, Khadijah will be your host in Washington DC.

In NYC, you will meet me, Idriys, and Chester. I am an actor/writer/director who is now beginning to study music. My son, Idriys, is my favorite thing. He loves art, sports, literature and music and is extremely good with small children (and animals) if you ever need a babysitter. We are a well traveled family having visited several countries on every continent except Australia (next stop :)). Idriys is studying Spanish and Mandarin in school , and I am picking up a bit of each myself. We adopted our pup Chester in May 2015. He is a sweet dog who loves people and animals. He is very well-behaved and gives us and our guests love but also space. He's very cool, no begging or barking and very well-mannered. The perfect dog for us! In addition to travel we love good food, art, good people, and hosting! What started out as a financial endeavor has turned out to be so much more. Through this business, we have met the loveliest people from all over the world many of whom have become people we truly consider friends. Its not unusual that our guests wind up inviting us to see a show, share a meal, or to explore the city with them. What a wonderful way to make a living by providing a peaceful environment, good energy, and a home away from home to people during their travels.

We're a laid back couple. We like to keep our place relatively neat and clean. We're respectful of others' privacy, but we also enjoy socializing and good conversation.

We love to cook and eat, and find great restaurants! When we travel, the first thing we think about is where we'll eat, and how we can best explore a country's typical foods.
When we host, we love to share our 20 years of experience in this neighborhood by recommending our favorite spots.

We have a fantastic view from our roof. When the weather's right, one of our favorite things to do is to sit up there with friends, have some drinks, and talk for hours.

I’ve stayed with many wonderful people, and wonderful people have stayed with me.  I hope you will too.
In my experience the Guest is tired, hungry, and cold, and needs to be treated for those conditions, besides being offered clean linen, a subway map, and a guide to the light switches.  (Oh yes, and a shower, laundry, and internet.  And a drink.)
Stay over – see New York from far and near – and I’ll try to do the same for you.
